# Naieve Bayes from Scratch



This folder contains the jupyter notebook I submitted for a university assignment in April 2017, along with a relevant data file. 



The notebook contains both the description of the problems I was assigned, and my solutions. All code and mathematics which appear below blue headings which read "Answer to Question x.xx" is authored by me.
